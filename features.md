# MyPiDash

MyPiDash is my first project working with my Raspberry Pi 5. This document is going to be a live document (subject to change at any time) of what I want this application to be.

## Summary

MyPiDash will be a customizable dashboard that the user can display to any external display from their Raspberry Pi. The whole application will live on the raspberry pi and will be easy to install and use. The way it will work is the content on the dashboard can be controlled from the users phone, if the phone is connected to the same network the raspberry pi is.

## Features

- Night Mode
- Ability to shut off Raspberry Pi or put it to sleep
- Ability to add todo items
- Show the time and day

## Possibilities:

- Use external APIs to display some content on the dashboard.

## Technologies

- Want all the services to be synced with Docker
